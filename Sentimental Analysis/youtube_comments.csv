33,"Unless the chicken has bones, it’s not the chicken for butter chicken just as if the chicken is not tandoor-flamed, it’s not the butter chicken, that we all love. Since tandoor is not common, stir frying strips of little chicken pieces is NOT butter chicken material and option.<br><br>Yours is just another variation of butter chicken that people starved of time and skill, would cook. <br><br>Thank you."

45,"Feedback piece ( and this seems to be applicable to more and more such channels). When you present a recipe, likely to people that have never done it before, it will be helpful to have ingredients measurements. &quot;Some&quot; this, &quot;some&quot; that is not cutting it"

76,I cooked and it turned out tasty
77,Very clear  your recipe
78,Thanks brother for your recipe
79,"My girls made a request for this dish. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs but I’ll try breast meat next time or maybe a bit of both. I don’t own a handheld immersion blender, so I used my nutribullet blender. I was pleased with the results, but I’ll probably invest in an immersion handheld blender now. Sadly my husband &amp; I can’t handle spice like my girls, so next time I’ll use half of the Kashmiri chili powder. I served w-naan &amp; basmati rice. This dish was a hit. Thank you bunches for making our Sunday dinner extra special."
80,Indian food is sooooo good
81,Well done chef. My son loves this recipe ❤❤❤❤
82,Amazing
83,That&#39;s not how to made it.

85,Dont you add cilantro at the end?
86,I think that you can speak Hindi be a indian?
87,Hi Varun I followed the written instructions in the description. But the recipe turned out way too sweet. The 4 tbsp of sugar mentioned is way too much. I&#39;d suggest just 1tbsp of sugar. Thanks.
88,"Wonderful recipe,just made it lat night and it turned out so good just like restaurant style . Made butter naan though to relish it with. Just amazing recipe. Easy nd tasty. Do try it guys👍"
89,what a penchod recipe
90,"I tried following this recipe but instead doubled everything as i wanted a larger portion. The butter chicken from this recipe tasted like sugar and vinegar. Disgusting! Barely edible.<br><br> Im not sure what i did wrong, as i followed both the video and recipe quantities in the description. I used measuring spoons for the spices and a scale for the tomatos and onions."
91,I see the original Butter Chicken does not contain onions in the gravy. So I guess this is a personal choice to go with it...
92,Vinegar made it sour (((
93,Can I make this without Cashews?
94,👌👌👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️

125,"Onion, tomato ,butter ,garam masala ,salt ,garlic ginger paste, chicken,red chilli powder,fresh cream,cashew nuts,sugar"
126,I&#39;ve never seen it made without yogurt or turmeric
127,"I made your recipe for the first time today, and it is divine! Definitely has that restaurant quality! Will be making it again!"
128,Can i use Amul Butter?
129,"This recipe is PHENOMENAL!! My wife and I are AVID Indian cuisine fans, and this butter chicken recipe gives high-end Indian restaurants a run for their money of this dish. This is our go-to cheat meal and it&#39;s worth every calorie. I found that I needed a lot more than just 3 tbsp of cream to achieve the &quot;creaminess&quot; represented in the video - we also double (or more) the chicken breast to fill the curry sauce up more! I highly recommend finding a good basmati rice, it pairs very nicely. Thank you for keeping your directions simple and easy to follow. I&#39;m never losing this recipe! Thank you again!"
130,"Udah buat enaaaak banget jadi nya, karena d toko sini ga ada parata, jadi beli canai aja dan tetep enak banget..makasih chef ilmu nya❤"
131,"I have never done a curry in my life and tonight was the first time. Never realised how easy it is and how delicious. Perfect recipe, the only different thing i did was to use chicken thighs as they are juicier.<br><br>Thanks for the video."
132,"And you will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. -Jeremiah 29:13<br><br>“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. -John 3:16<br><br>Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out.<br>-Acts 3:19<br><br>  :)<br><br>      :)"

155,Everything was good but my chicken was a little Chevy. Should I use smaller pieces instead of larger cubes
156,Can u use peanuts?

334,What is the replacement for malt vinegar? I usually skip that step in the recipe because I don&#39;t have that and don&#39;t even know how it tastes like or what flavour it would bring to the dish. Can you please advice an alternative for malt vinegar?
335,"LOVE this recipe! Yum yum in my tum - making this again today!!! Thank you Varun. <br><br>I made it, it was SOOOO good! Making it again now 3 weeks later!"
336,अच्छा है बटर चिकन मैने बनाया 👍 बड्या है❤
337,"Excellent recipe! I&#39;ve made this a few times now. I&#39;ve played around with proportions of some of the ingredients but my favourite iteration is pretty close to the original recipe. I just add a bit more garam masala. What I like to do is make 4x the recipe but just the sauce/gravy and then I portion out and freeze the rest. It freezes really well. Then when I thaw out a batch, I marinade the chicken and cook it fresh instead of freezing the chicken with the sauce. It&#39;s a great way to have a restaurant quality meal that comes together as quickly as it takes to cook the rice."
338,"bhai g fat gayi khake, sexy hai bro, also guys this is what i did, i had no cream so i used thoda sa milk, okayish alternative but sexy taste ngl"

413,"Delicious! Made a few personal adjustments the second time around. I added plain yogurt to the marinade. Also added fresh red chilis while cooking, cause I like it spicy, and shallots instead of red onion. I used unsalted chicken stock instead of water, coconut milk instead of cream, and a dash of turmeric powder. Turned out Perfect!"

1142,Just tried this. I love hot strong curries but there was way too many spices. I was sceptical beforehand but followed the plan. Are you sure you have written it correct? Not put tbsp instead of tsp? The wife couldnt eat it. I am used to phals and vindaloos and I struggled.
1143,Can I use regular plain yogurt instead of curd I can’t find it anywhere.
1144,I tried this recipe with chapathi. it tasted so good. I didn’t add milk and marinated less than 1 hour still it was tasty.

1157,"Filipino here. Liked Indian foods too. <br>I noticed turmeric, cumin, chili and onion are the core ingredients of most Indian foods. Followed by coriander, cardamom, black peppers. <br>The other spices I haven&#39;t distinctly encountered or maybe I have unknowingly tasted.  <br>I liked curries, masala, samosa, lamb and chicken biryani(moderately spicy though, not too much). Most I tried are southern Indian foods kerala, I think. I worked in KSA before, where I had an Indian friend who gave me tips what restaurants and where to eat. MissIng these foods though."

1178,"This is the best Indian chicken curry I have ever made or eaten… the hype is real. It’s clear why this video has almost 6 million views. It takes a little longer than most other recipes but the extra time and patience is rewarded by remarkable perfect layers of flavour. Often these types of recipes leave one feeling like “It needs more salt, or less garam masala, or some modification to the original recipe.” This doesn’t. Make it as is and you will be rewarded with the most perfect and delicious flavours. Thank you!"

The only modifications I made were that I used boneless chicken breast and instead of red chili powder I used kashmiri chili powder since it&#39;s less spicy. I followed everything else exactly and it was amazing. I might use less salt in the gravy next time

2015,Letters are too small
2016,Yummy
2017,What i realised from this is that - if you are going to cook it in large quantity..like feeding a whole party..then DIY like this video may be better..but if youre cooking for yourself and maybe a friend...then the ingredients and stuffs will cost more than actually ordering from it kfc itself
2018,Give me some pics
2019,What about the eggs?
2020,Did you use the seasoning pack from ramen noodles?
2021,The song is so sick

2087,It&#39;s very very perfect I tried it out🤤🤤
2088,Can we use air fryer to do the same
2089,"TRY TASTING IT , MAYBE RAW INSIDE."
2090,"Really nice, must try dish❤🎉"
2091,"For anyone looking to try this, don&#39;t use water as suggested. It&#39;ll break down and weaken most of the first coating, or make it come out like a shell upon frying it. Other recipes suggest using a mix of egg, milk, and a tiny bit of flour, which definitely holds better than double dipping them in water."
2092,instead of instead noodle masala u can use msg
2093,Trust me too much unhealthy dish
2094,Sounds name? <br>Please reply 🙏
2095,Instant noodle masala ??? What is it <br>Which shop do you get ??

2102,What the name of pan used in the video<br>Is it steel or aluminium?
2103,1. Taste was awesome.<br>2. color was bit dark and did not match the one which is shown in video.<br>3. MAINLY  texture did not come as shown in video even after following the same procedure as shown. Let me know what would be the mistake from my end.
2104,How much time in fryd

2110,I was watching food theory I then thought &#39; KFC secret recipe search it up easy&#39;😂
2111,It looks dry inside but i&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t. That was probably the white meat.

2346,All purpose flour means?
2347,What is all purpose flour?
2348,Does chicken have to boil?

2357,I just ordered from KFC.. It&#39;s yummy
2358,Ok
2359,I Tried It By Looking At Your Video On April 2021. It Did Not Come As A Real KFC Chicken. It Came As A Normal Chicken Fry.
2360,"I just ate Kentucky the Singapore quality is so bad that I have to mak t myself, I felt it was pressure stem bfore fry"
2361,To take it in Water??? I never see it
2362,Tried this was great!
2363,That dip in water tho
2364,"the cooking method is not correct, kfc uses pressure cookers with oil for proper cooking, frying it just like that, the meat around the bone remains raw, even bacteria inside the bone are not eliminated, before eating, put the chicken inside a microwave 1 minute at maximum, to guarantee a correct elimination of bacteria inside the bone and around it."
2365,Instead of water can we dip in egg
2366,What instant noodle mix should I use??
2367,Not working
2368,"It works, i made it, tastes decent, instead of noodle masala use kebab powder and instead of soya sauce use lemon to be more pocket friendly."
2369,I want to eat KFC style chicken
2370,Disgusting
2371,Instant noodles masala I don&#39;t get it

2383,Looks so tasty but. I can&#39;t make it at my home

2391,"OK, I have to say, KFC Extra Crispy recipe has been my favorite fried chicken since it came out, but this does not resemble it. KFC Extra Crispy is <b>not</b> &quot;spicy&quot; and so there are a lot of ingredient here which make this <b>NOT</b> a KFC copycat. So I have to ask... what country serves &quot;Spicy&quot; KFC Crispy chicken? This may be wonderful chicken, but it&#39;s not KFC - at least not the KFC that they serve in the Southern US, where KFC originated."
